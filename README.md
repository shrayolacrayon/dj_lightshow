TODO
======
* We need to figure out how to connect the Wifi from the computer to the arduino and use node.js to connect the wifly. Johnny 5 is confusing
* smooth out the motions to make them less undefined : potentially adding in a fingers component to the gestures so that in addition to having swiping, it maybe also needs to have a certain number of fingers (which might make it less confusing)
* Add the mechanial motions part (moving the servo and the steppers)
* control LEDs and stepper that controls the LEDs
